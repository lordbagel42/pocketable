if a corne and a zsa voyager had a child\_

This project was made for one primary reason: my old split keyboard design kinda sucked to make layouts for. The thumb cluster was horrible. This, however, will function with ZSA Voyager layouts, which are generally shared publicly and well-tested.

This will be for sale eventually. Please reply to [issue 1](https://github.com/lordbagel42/pocketable/issues/1) if you would like to buy one. Cost will be around $240 per keyboard.

## but why?

This keyboards a little special compared to most, for one reason: it's almost all made in-house by me. I'll be machining the brass plate myself along with the wooden base case, plus laser-cutting the acrylic LED cover myself. It's also all hand soldered and one day will have custom keycaps. For now though I've been graciously sponsored with black keycaps.
