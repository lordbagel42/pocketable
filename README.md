This is a cutting board. Notably, it's a handmade wooden cutting board with 3 different types of wood in it. This is what I'm going to be making this keyboard into, as I have access to a professional woodshop and enough types of CNC to make something like this.

This will actually be for sale once I have a decent methodology for making the case multiple times, as I've already had multiple people reach out.

I would put a decent looking render in but my blender instance just...doesn't open anymore? So I can't get renders functioning sadly.
